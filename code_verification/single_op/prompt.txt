Task: Translate the given CUDA code to its equivalent C code.  
Context: You are provided with a CUDA code snippet that needs to be translated into C code. The translation should preserve the same functionality and structure as much as possible. Focus on translating the CUDA-specific parallel constructs into C constructs, such as using OpenMP for parallelism. The resulting C code should be complete and ready to compile. 
 Following are some details of the cuda code: 
- Operation Name: {op_name} 
- Operation Arguments: {op_args} 
- Input Shape: {input_shape} 
- Output Shape: {output_shape}
Input CUDA Code: {cuda_code}
Print only single C function implementation, end with comment '|End-of-Code|'.
